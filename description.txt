A simple mod that forces NPC housing banners to always display, no matter if the housing menu is open or closed.

NOTE: By default, NPCs cannot be kicked out unless you are in the housing menu. This may be changed in the config.

Changelog:
 - 1.0.0.0: Release
 - 1.0.0.1: Added icon.
 - 1.0.0.2: Ported to tModLoader v0.12 Alpha.
 - 1.0.1.0: Added a toggle button for banner visibility, similar to The Grand Design and the Architect Gizmo Pack.
 - 1.0.1.1: Removed some leftover debug statements. Oops.
